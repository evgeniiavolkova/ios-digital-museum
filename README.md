### My school project for the course iOS mobile application development

# iOS Digital Museum
OS Digital Museum is an iOS application written in SwiftUI that utilizes Firebase Firestore for storing information about museum paintings. The application also uses machine learning to identify the author of a painting based on a user-provided photo.

The project is written in **SwiftUI** with **MVVM** architecture.

## Features
* View paintings in AR format
* Upload or take a photo and the app will suggest a list of the most likely authors of the painting
* Browse a list of artists and information about them and their works
* Browse a list of paintings and information about them

## What I Learned
* **ARKit** for viewing images in augmented reality
* **CoreML** for author identification.
* **SpriteKit** for loading animations
